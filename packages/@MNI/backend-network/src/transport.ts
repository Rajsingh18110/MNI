/**
 * Pure transport entry point (`@MNI/backend-network/transport`).
 *
 * Exposes the dispatcher/fetch core of the outbound HTTP transport with no DI,
 * `@MNI/config`, `@MNI/backend-common` or `MNI-workflow` dependency: its only
 * runtime import is `undici`. This is the construction path for DI-less callers
 * (e.g. task-runner code) that must build a proxy/SSRF-aware transport without
 * dragging the full `OutboundHttp` service — and its backend dependencies —
 * into their bundle.
 *
 * `OutboundHttp` (the `@MNI/di` service) wraps this same core, so there is a
 * single implementer of transport construction across the codebase.
 *
 * The Node `http.Agent` path (`getNodeAgent` / `buildNodeAgents`) is
 * intentionally NOT re-exported here: it is not yet dependency-free.
