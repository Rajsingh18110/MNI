/**
 * Dependency purity guard: living documentation of why `@MNI/scheduler` is pure.
 *
 * ## A blueprint, not a mandate
 *
 * This is *one* way to draw modularity boundaries, not a house rule. Treat it as
 * a worked example to argue with. It is something concrete to ground a discussion
 * about where MNI wants its layers. Nobody is obliged to copy it. The value is in
 * making the trade-offs explicit enough to debate.
 *
 * ## The design choice
 *
 * `@MNI/scheduler` is the pure-logic core of the durable scheduler. Deciding
 * *what is due* (materializer, executor claim logic, reaper/fencing, recurrence
 * math, retention windows) is deliberately separated from *doing it* and from
 * *where the state lives*.
 *
 * The core is a deterministic decision engine. Every effect is handed in through
 * a port rather than reached for. Storage arrives as the executor and retention
 * stores, time as a `Clock`, tracing as a `Tracer`. The adapters that actually
 * touch a database or the host live at the edges, inside `@MNI/db` repositories
 * and the cli wiring. The core never reaches for them.
 *
 * Keeping this boundary is what makes the core cheap to test and to reuse. Unit
 * tests run with no database and no container. `fast-check` property tests and
 * Stryker mutation tests hammer the logic directly. No SQL or TypeORM detail
 * leaks in, so the same code runs on any dialect. And the whole package can be
 * lifted out of a full MNI main, which is exactly what the scheduler-worker idea
 * below relies on.
 *
 * Nothing in the language enforces this. A stray import from `@MNI/db` or a
 * `node:fs` reference would quietly erode the purity and no test would fail. This
 * test is the enforcement. The lists further down are the documentation of what
 * is allowed and, more importantly, what is excluded and why.
 *
 * ## Why bother: the constraint is the feature
 *
 * Day to day, this boundary looks like friction. It is faster to import the
 * repository and run the query right here, or to grab a service off the DI
 * container because it is already there. The payoff is not in the next hour of
 * DX. It is in what the constraint forces the codebase to become. The allowlist
 * is a forcing function that makes us think in layers instead of reaching for
 * whatever is nearest. The reasoning, step by step.
 *
 * 1. Name the one job and refuse the rest. This package decides *what is due*. It
 *    does not run the work, store the state, or wire itself into an app. Once
 *    that sentence is the contract, "should this code live here?" has an answer
 *    instead of a vibe, and unrelated concerns stop piling up in the core.
 *
 * 2. Turn every effect into a port the caller hands in. Anything that touches the
 *    world, the database, the clock, the network, tracing, arrives as an
 *    interface rather than something acquired inside. The core receives
 *    capabilities and never goes looking for them. That is why storage and time
 *    are arguments, and why `@MNI/db` and the Node I/O built-ins are excluded.
 *
 * 3. Say no to the container even when it is convenient. We do not register
 *    things in DI just because we can. Inside a leaf, a container hides the real
 *    dependency graph and adds a runtime you have to boot before you can test.
 *    Plain typed arguments keep the graph visible and the tests trivial, so
 *    `@MNI/di` stays out, and so does `@MNI/config`, which is built on it.
 *
 * 4. Stay ignorant of who calls you. How a Wait node or a Schedule Trigger node
 *    gets scheduled is a *use* of this package, not a concern of it. The
 *    scheduler must not know its consumers exist. That keeps the dependency arrow
 *    pointing one way, from the cli and the nodes toward the scheduler and never
 *    back. It is why importing the cli (`MNI`) is forbidden. That import would
 *    flip the arrow.
 *
 * 5. Aim for a pure leaf. Follow the four steps and the package settles at the
 *    bottom of the graph with no effectful edges. It becomes a decision engine
 *    you can unit-test without a database, stress with property and mutation
 *    tests, run against any dialect, and lift into a standalone worker. That
 *    pure-leaf shape is the target this test defends, one import at a time.
 *
 * ## Exploring the idea: a `@MNI/scheduler-worker` deployable
 *
 * Here is a concrete scenario the pure leaf unlocks. It is a thought exercise,
 * not a plan. Today the cli owns the port bindings. `DurableScheduler` wires the
 * `@MNI/db` repositories as the task store and transaction runner, `Tracing` as
 * the `Tracer`, `GlobalConfig` as the options, and `ScheduleTriggerTaskHandler`
 * as the `TaskHandler`. One direction worth exploring is to lift that wiring into
 * a `@MNI/scheduler-worker` package and deploy it as its own process, dedicated
 * to scheduling.
 *
 * Relocating the scheduler itself is free, because it is a pure leaf with no
 * effectful edges to untangle. The cost is everywhere else. When a task is due
 * the worker should not run the workflow inline, since that would pull in the
 * whole node-execution engine. In a scaled deployment it instead creates an
 * execution and publishes a job to the queue (Bull and Redis), and the regular
 * workers run it. So the worker's real `TaskHandler` is "create an execution and
 * enqueue it".
 *
 * That capability lives inside the cli today, tangled through
 * `WorkflowExecutionService`, the scaling service, `ExecutionRepository`, and the
 * trigger-context builders. The worker cannot simply import the cli to get it,
 * because the cli will import the worker and the dependency would be circular. So
 * the real work is decomposing the cli, pulling the shared concerns down into
 * leaf packages that both the cli and the worker can depend on. The rough
 * candidates, names still open, are a workflow-execution publisher that creates
 * the execution row and enqueues it (this is where Bull and Redis would actually
 * live, in the publisher rather than in the scheduler), the trigger-context and
 * additional-data building that a run needs, and the instance identity and config
 * slices the loops read.
 *
 * Once you list what the worker would actually bundle, it comes out far leaner
 * than the `cli` it grew out of. `cli` drags in every node's dependencies
 * (1Password, S3, and hundreds more). The worker needs only what scheduling and
 * enqueuing require:
 *
 *   - `@MNI/scheduler` for the core, and `@MNI/db` for the repositories and
 *     transactions (which brings in `@MNI/typeorm` and a database driver)
 *   - a new publisher package to enqueue executions (Bull and ioredis)
 *   - `@MNI/backend-common` for logging, with `@MNI/config`, `@MNI/di`,
 *     `@MNI/decorators` and `MNI-workflow` to wire and type it
 *   - today, `MNI-core` for instance identity and error reporting, unless those
 *     get extracted too
 *
 * It leaves behind the bulk of MNI: the editor, the REST API, the node registry,
 * and every node's dependency. The win is a process whose scheduling scales and
 * fails on its own, and getting there is mostly `cli` decomposition. Purity made
 * the scheduler side free to move. The same discipline one level up is what makes
 * the worker shippable.
 *
 * ## What each excluded dependency would cost us
 *
 * See `FORBIDDEN_PACKAGES` and `FORBIDDEN_NODE_BUILTINS`. Each entry carries its
 * justification inline. The short version. The DB and ORM packages would tie the
 * core to a dialect and a running database. `MNI-core` is the *doing* side. The
 * DI container `@MNI/di`, together with `@MNI/config` and `@MNI/backend-common`
 * that build on it, would hide the ports behind a global registry instead of
 * explicit injection. The cli (`MNI`) is the app wiring and depends on us, not
 * the other way around. And the Node I/O built-ins are effects that belong behind
 * a port.
 *
 * We do not ban every `node:` built-in, only the effectful ones that do I/O. A
 * pure-computation built-in like `node:crypto` stays allowed, because hashing is
 * deterministic and the boundary we defend is effects, not standard-library use.
