/**
 * Constants consumed by `versions.store` (`@MNI/stores`). Relocated per-symbol
 * from `editor-ui`'s `@/app/constants` when the store moved into a package
 * (MNI-70). They live here because the modal keys have two consumers on
 * opposite sides of that boundary — the store, and the app-side registration in
 * `@/app/constants/modals` — and this package is a leaf both already depend on.
